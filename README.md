# Password Generator

## Third Challenge for UC Berkeley Extension Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp Course

This website is the completed code for the third "challenge" of the course, to create a password generator, which included these instructions:
* Present a series of prompts
* Prompt for password length
* Prompt for types of characters to include: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* Error-check user entries to ensure a valid output
* Generate and display a password

## What Was Done (and Not Done)

1. Used an array to store password characters drawn at random.
2. Created objects to collect information related to each character type.
3. Created an array of these character-type objects to facilitate using `for` loops to deal with each character type.
4. Developed messages and prompts to the user and error-check functions to deal with responses.
5. Refactored the code to hopefully make it easier to understand.

I believe the completed code meets the challenge criteria, however there are a couple of items that I did not have time to do, but would be desirable.  I would have liked to set up a form interface as an alternative for users -- the page would be much more usable this way -- but this was not a priority as it seems a big part of the challenge is to write the error-checking.  Also, it would be good to have a choice to generate another password using the same criteria that were just entered.  I have made both of these issues on GitHub.

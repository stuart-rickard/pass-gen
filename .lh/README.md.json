I would have liked to set up a form interface as an alternative for users -- the page would be much more usable this way -- but this was not a priority as it seems a big part of the challenge is to write the error-checking.  Also, it would be good to have a choice to generate another password using the same criteria that were just entered.  I have made both of these issues on GitHub.\n   \n ## Link to Live Password Generator\n   \n The live password generator webpage can be found at this link: \n"
